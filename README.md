1. There is nothing more complex in the code , we have used a rest API

   restaurant management to one another in simple words.

5. It will ask for the country name for which you want complete details of all the holidays in that country.
6. This API works on country codes system so rather then giving the whole country name u just have to give its code that is associated with it already
